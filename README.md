# NLU-first-assignment
This repository contains the notebook `Assignment1.ipynb` with my resolution of the first assignment for the NLU course of 2020/2021. 
The notebook also includes a description of all the five asked functions above each block separating the five asked functions, and since in piazza it was specified that it can be done istead of creating a separate report document, I choose to put all in the notebook so that everithing is in one place.

# Requirements
Only `spacy` (and it's english model) was used as additional library
- run `pip install spacy` for spacy itself
- run `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm` for the english model
